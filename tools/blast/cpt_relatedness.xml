**What it does**

This tool attempts to filter a set of blast results and return the top
related genomes based on number (and score) of protein-protein matches.

**How it works**

The blast results are read in, the gene ID numbers are parsed out (and
their accession numbers are automatically determined), and then these are
clustered based on the organism that the blast hit is to.

Once this is done, we look at each organism's set of hits and calculate a
score based on the number of hits and their e-values.

These scores are ranked, and a list of top-related organisms is output at
the end.
