This pathway of prokaryotic lysine biosynthesis via alpha-aminoadipate was discovered in the hyper-thermophilic Gram-negative eubacterium Thermus thermophilus. The pathway proceeds as follows: alpha-ketoglutarate is converted to homocitrate, which is metabolized to 3-carboxyhex-2-enedioate and then homoisocitrate. This is then decarboxylated to form alpha-ketoadipate, which is then converted to alpha-aminoadipate. This undergoes acetylation, to form N2-acetyl-alpha-aminoadipate, and is then phosphorylated to give N2-acetyl-alpha-aminoadipyl-delta-phosphate. This is converted to N2-acetyl-alpha-aminoadipate semialdehyde, which is then converted to N2-acetyl-L-lysine. A final deacetylation reaction produces L-lysine.

This is then decarboxylated to form alpha-ketoadipate, which is then converted to alpha-aminoadipate. This is then reduced to form alpha-aminoadipate 6-semialdehyde, which is metabolized to saccharopine and finally L-lysine.
