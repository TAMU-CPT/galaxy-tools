# Proximity (to Lysis) Scripts
_aside: Some of the scripts that are prepatory scripts, have been moved, and thus their paths for some of the calls they make will raise errors. When/If this is ever ran from the ground up again, that will need to be remedied first_

_aside#2: planemo test will need to be regenerated because of the XML alterations, and need to test the prox function. I'll still likely just stick with one test case_

### `searchFile.py`
* Script that searches a multitude of filetypes, and multiple at a time, and queries the file(s) for terms selected by the user.
* `--prox` flag enables the proximity2lysis GFF3 output

### `editDB.py`
* Script that finds redudancy, and other issues, with the `...expanded.json` output and resolves said issues.
* Functions to modify the database, and output a new version.

## `/prep-data`
### `generateLysisFamily.py`
* Numerous list with lysis family relationships. Output is a dictionary --to-a--> json that stores these relationships for future use.

### `explodeJSON.py`
* Quick and easy class that will permit (easy) json manipulation.

### `goQuery.py`
* Takes terms from the lysis-family.json and queries quickgo

### `goSynonymAdd.py`
* Merges the lysis-family.json object with results from quickgo

## `/data`
* Check README of this directory to see details on the `.txt` and `.json` files.
* Order of scripts to generate `lysis-family-expanded.json` (this is the dbase used in query scripts/galaxy tools)
    * `generateLysisFamily.py`
    * `goQuery.py` + curate results --- _then_ ---> `goSynonymAdd.py`
    * I don't feel like the list was appropriately parsed down, especially during the merger. Thus run the output json from the above through `editDB.py`

## `/test-data`
* `/other`
    * test.json for testing various scripts. Used for `goQuery.py`
    * sample.gff3
    * sample.fa
    * sample.xml
* `/general_use` :: for running planemo test as well as testing the overall function of the script
* `/prox` :: for testing the proximity to lysis portion of this tool

## Order for reproducing database
1. generateLysisFamily.py
2. goQuery.py
3. goSynonymAdd.py
4. (optional) editDB.py

# Release Notes:
CPT: OTHER- Search File
In light of various lysis projects, searching for lysis-related terms within files can be useful. This tool allows for the querying of GFF3, FASTA, Genbank, and/or BLAST-xml files with a user defined set of terms. The terms can either be from the curated lysis family term database, a custom set of terms, or both. Each query term is passed to each file, to see if it is within the contents (similar to CTRL+F), but it queries specific places, specific to the file type. For example, genbankâ€™s product and notes qualifier is queried. Matches of each filetype are returned in an output file that allows users to see the contents of what was matched.
