# Proximity (to Lysis) Scripts
## `generateLysisFamily.py`
* Numerous list with lysis family relationships. Output is a dictionary --to-a--> json that stores these relationships for future use.

## `explodeJSON.py`
* Quick and easy class that will permit (easy) json manipulation.

## `fileProx.py`
* GALAXY tool that allows users to query an input file for a set of search terms; either custom, dbase, or a combination of the two.

## `goQuery.py`
* Takes terms from the lysis-family.json and queries quickgo

## `goSynonymAdd.py`
* Merges the lysis-family.json object with results from quickgo

## `searchFile.py`
* Script that searches a multitude of filetypes, and multiple at a time, and queries the file(s) for terms selected by the user.

## `cleanDB.py`
* Script that finds redudancy, and other issues, with the `...expanded.json` output and resolves said issues.

# `/data`
* Check README of this directory to see details on the `.txt` and `.json` files.
* Order of scripts to generate `lysis-family-expanded.json` (this is the dbase used in query scripts/galaxy tools)
    * `generateLysisFamily.py`
    * `goQuery.py` + curate results --- _then_ ---> `goSynonymAdd.py`
    * I don't feel like the list was appropriately parsed down, especially during the merger. Thus run the output json from the above through `cleanDB.py`

# `/test-data`
* test.json for testing various scripts. Used for `goQuery.py`
* sample.gff3
* sample.fa
* sample.xml
* search.txt

# Release Notes:
CPT: OTHER- Search File
In light of various lysis projects, searching for lysis-related terms within files can be useful. This tool allows for the querying of GFF3, FASTA, Genbank, and/or BLAST-xml files with a user defined set of terms. The terms can either be from the curated lysis family term database, a custom set of terms, or both. Each query term is passed to each file, to see if it is within the contents (similar to CTRL+F), but it queries specific places, specific to the file type. For example, genbankâ€™s product and notes qualifier is queried. Matches of each filetype are returned in an output file that allows users to see the contents of what was matched.
