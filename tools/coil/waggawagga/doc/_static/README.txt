These files have been copied here since they belong to the Sphinx 
'basic' theme and should be available at::

  /usr/share/sphinx/themes/basic/static

on this server. For some reason however they are not. This is the list
of files::

  000673 ajax-loader.gif
   8.491 basic.css_t
   3.445 comment.png
   3.500 comment-bright.png
   3.578 comment-close.png
   6.840 doctools.js
     363 down.png
     368 down-pressed.png
     392 file.png
  93.868 jquery.js
     199 minus.png
     199 plus.png
  11.790 searchtools.js_t
  12.140 underscore.js
     363 up.png
     372 up-pressed.png
  25.246 websupport.js

Maybe some of them are not needed. The files can be found in this 
repository last changed at 2012-03-25::

  https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/sphinx/src/7832936c6f4e/sphinx/themes/basic/static

  
Afterwards these two files have been deleted from typo3sphinx/static
as they are not needed and lead to errors::

   08.491 basic.css_t
   11.790 searchtools.js_t
  
End.
