# Overview and Summary
* This tool is a wrapped and "CPT/Galaxy-ized" version of [DNA Features, from Edenburgh-Genome-Foundry](https://github.com/Edinburgh-Genome-Foundry/DnaFeaturesViewer)

## Requirements
* dna_features_viewer
* bcbio-gff
* Biopython
* pandas

## _CONDA_
* This tool is currently (06.29) not implemented into Conda. Due to this I did a "patch" job of copy/pasting this into the tool dir to have it function. Long term "upkeep" of this tool should have this tool sent to conda (either by ourselves), or request it be done by the maker.
