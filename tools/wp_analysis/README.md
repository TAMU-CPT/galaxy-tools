# Overview
This tool is used to retrieve information about WPs.
__aside: Eventually, this should use a combination of the `cpt-aux`'s `pymods` developing module AND @AC's gff3 package.__


## WP_data
_what it does:_
* Returns the amount of identical proteins assigned to the protein.
* Returns the first or **ALL** proteins under the WP accession.
* Taxon information, taxon id and organism data, is also fetched.

## Extra Information
* [NCBI non redundant proteins information](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/about/nonredundantproteins/)

## External Requirements
