# `find-spanin.py` overview

## The goal of this tool is to take putative protein sequences and determine if any of them are quality candidates for a potential spanin pair (OSP/ISP)

## Requirements:

## To-dos:
[x] - Determine Methodology for ORF function in CPT.py
[x] - User input 
    * FASTA (<s>preferred</s>done) ; <s>not entire .gb file. We only want the sequence</s>
[ ] - Output putative .fasta files 
[ ] - Mimic returns from `findSpanin.pl` / Best candidate file (?) 
    * These include:
        * Overlap spanins
        * Covered spanins
        * Next-to spanins
