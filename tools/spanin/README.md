# `find-spanin.py` overview

## The goal of this tool is to take putative protein sequences and determine if any of them are quality candidates for a potential spanin pair (OSP/ISP)

## Requirements:

## To-dos:
[ ] - Determine Methodology for ORF function in CPT.py
[ ] - User input 
    * FASTA (preferred) ; not entire .gb file. We only want the sequence
    * What else...
[ ] - Mimic Calls from `findSpanin.pl` 
    * These include:
        * Overlap spanins
        * Covered spanins
        * Next-to spanins
[ ] - Output putative .txt files with best candidate file.
