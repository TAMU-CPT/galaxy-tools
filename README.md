# CPT Galaxy Tools

The Center for Phage Technology's Galaxy tools.

The repository quality is currently all over the place, so please don't use
this as examples of good practice or anything :) Eventually all of these tools
will be folded into one of the other large repositories for continued
maintenance, such as Bj√∂rn's
[galaxytools](https://github.com/bgruening/galaxytools) or the IUC
[repo](https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-iuc)

## Contribution

If you'd like to contribute new tools or bugfixes to this repo, please do so via Pull Requests and ensure that you apply [Black code formatting](https://github.com/psf/black) to any changes before merging to Master.

## Nota Bene

NONE of these tools are written/configured for the Toolshed. They will be
eventually, but that's a wishlist item.

## LICENSE

Except where otherwise noted, all code is GPLv3.
